# Prediction-of-Arrhythmia-using-ioT-and-AI
Arrhythmia is a group of conditions where the heart rate is irregular i.e either too fast (above 100 beats per minute) or too slow (below 60 beats per minute). A support vector classifier is trained on the dataset (from UCI Machine Learning Repository) and achieves an accuracy of 78% on this binary classification problem.
